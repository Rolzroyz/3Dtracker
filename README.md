NOTE: The currrent files that we have in our master branch are not complete. We need to add Dr. Klays Voxel class to the master brach so that the code
in this branch will work. (At least I think so anyways)

The goal of our project is to analyze and describe partical trajectories.

Our basic outline is to 

* Format data - separate incoming data into a rectilinear format that will then be section off into linear arrays
* Filter - create a filter that will sort through the data using smaller groupings of local data to identify clusters with limited hardware footprint
* Calculate - mathematically describe the clusters of data, at this time we are unsure of what the best algorithm would be to compliment those already existing
* Visualise - create a visual representation that will allow interested parties to have a straightforward interpretation the data
