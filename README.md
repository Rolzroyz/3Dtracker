The goal of our project is to analyze and describe partical trajectories.

Our basic outline is to 

* Format data - separate incoming data into a rectilinear format that will then be section off into liner arrays
* Filter - create a filter that will sort through the data using smaller groupings of local data to identify clusters with limited hardware footprint
* Calculate - mathematically describe the clusters of data, at this time we are unsure of what the best algorithm would be to compliment those already existing
* Visualise - create a visual representation that will allow interested parties to have a straightforward interpretation the data
